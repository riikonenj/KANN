Description: Efficient genetic ancestry estimation for new query samples based on a set of reference samples with ancestry fractions to a number of source populations. As an input, KANN requires a data.table object of reference sample ancestries, and PC-coordinates and eigenvalues for both query and reference samples. Dummy data is provided with the package. Ancestry estimation with KANN is based on k-nearest neighbor regression in principal component space.
